# TutorTrack
A web application acting as a hub for parents and tutors to track the progress of tutees. 

Tutors can login to:
- Enter details about their sessions and view them in an organised way.
- Record student scores on tests/worksheets/exercises set and view them in a format organised by either student or topic.
- Generate reports analysing student performance across all topics and generate revision lists.

Parents can login to view:
- A record of their child's previous tutoring sessions, including feedback and details for each session.
- Their child's progression in particular topics based on the results logged by their tutor.

An automated mailing system is used to keep parents updated.

The website is available [here](https://mattblessing.eu.pythonanywhere.com). Please note that this is not currently being maintained.
